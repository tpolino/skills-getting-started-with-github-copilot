   </a>

2. In the new tab, most of the fields will automatically fill in for you.

   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will use [Actions minutes](https://docs.github.chttps://github.com/tpolino/skills-getting-started-with-github-copilot/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.

3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds for the exercise to be prepared.

   - The **Copy Exercise** button will deactivate, changing to gray.
   - The **Start Exercise** button will activate, changing to green.

4. Click **Start Exercise**. Follow the step-by-step instructions and feedback will be provided as you progress.
